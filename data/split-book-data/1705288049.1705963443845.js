window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>This is the account of torture and murder by experiment in the name of scientific research and patriotism. </b></p> <p>The author describes the experience of being in bombed-out, dangerous, post-war Nuremberg, where she lived for two years while working on the trial. Once a Nazi sympathizer tossed bombs into the dining room of the hotel where she lived moments before she arrived for dinner. She takes us into the courtroom to hear the dramatic testimony and see the reactions of the defendants to the proceedings. The witnesses tell of experiments in which they were deprived of oxygen; frozen; injected with malaria, typhus, and jaundice; subjected to the amputation of healthy limbs; forced to drink seawater for weeks at a time; and other horrors.&nbsp;</p> <p>This landmark trial resulted in the establishment of the Nuremberg Code, which sets the guidelines for medical research involving human beings. <i>Doctors from Hell</i> is a significant addition to the literature on World War II and the Holocaust, medical ethics, human rights, and the barbaric depths to which human beings can descend.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Contains mature themes.</b></p>";
