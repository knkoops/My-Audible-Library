window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>INSTANT</b><b><i> NEW YORK TIMES </i></b><b>BESTSELLER!<br> <br> “Very few authors have the power to make you laugh on one page and cry on the next. Moyes is one of them.”&nbsp;—</b><b><i>The&nbsp;New York Times</i></b></p> <p><b>A story of mix-ups, mess-ups and making the most of second chances, this is the new novel from #1 </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> bestselling author Jojo Moyes, author of </b><b><i>Me Before You</i></b><b> and </b><b><i>The Giver of Stars</i></b><b><br> <br> Who are you when you are forced to walk in someone else’s shoes?</b><br> <br> Nisha Cantor lives the globetrotting life of the seriously wealthy, until her husband announces a divorce and cuts her off. Nisha is determined to hang onto her glamorous life. But in the meantime, she must scramble to cope--she doesn’t even have the shoes she was, until a moment ago, standing in.<br> <br> That’s because Sam Kemp—in the bleakest point of her life—has accidentally taken Nisha’s gym bag. But Sam hardly has time to worry about a lost gym bag—she’s struggling to keep herself and her family afloat. When she tries on Nisha’s six-inch high Christian Louboutin red crocodile shoes, the resulting jolt of confidence that makes her realize something must change—and that thing is herself.<br> <br> Full of Jojo Moyes’ signature humor, brilliant storytelling, and warmth, <i>Someone Else’s Shoes</i> is a story about how just one little thing can suddenly change everything.</p>";
