In the thriving intellectual culture of 1930s Berlin, the newlyweds create a rich new life filled with love, friendships, and rewarding work - but the rise of a malevolent new political faction inexorably changes their fate.&nbsp;</p> <p>As Adolf Hitler and his Nazi Party wield violence and lies to seize power, Mildred, Arvid, and their friends resolve to resist. Mildred gathers intelligence for her American contacts, including Martha Dodd, the vivacious and very modern daughter of the US ambassador. Her German friends, aspiring author Greta Kuckoff and literature student Sara Weiss, risk their lives to collect information from journalists, military officers, and officials within the highest levels of the Nazi regime.&nbsp;</p> <p>For years, Mildred’s network stealthily fights to bring down the Third Reich from within. But when Nazi radio operatives detect an errant Russian signal, the Harnack resistance cell is exposed, with fatal consequences.&nbsp;</p> <p>Inspired by actual events, <i>Resistance Women</i> is an enthralling, unforgettable story of ordinary people determined to resist the rise of evil, sacrificing their own lives and liberty to fight injustice and defend the oppressed.</p> <p><b>This audiobook includes an episode of the</b><b><i> Book Club Girl Podcast</i></b><b>, featuring an interview with Jennifer Chiaverini about </b><b><i>Resistance Women</i></b><b>. </b></p>";
