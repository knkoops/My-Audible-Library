While reading it in a café, Gabby, as if by magic, meets the man of her dreams. Thinking the story might have some special power to it, Gabby shares it with her sister and other friends, who all find instant love.&nbsp;Word of mouth spreads, and Alice stumbles upon&nbsp;a new calling—to be a love scribe.<br> <br> But not all the love stories she writes unfold as expected. And while Alice tries to harness her extraordinary gift,&nbsp;she is summoned to a mansion in the woods where she encounters the reclusive&nbsp;Madeline&nbsp;Alger and her mysterious library. As&nbsp;Alice struggles to write a story for&nbsp;Madeline, her most challenging assignment yet, she’s forced to confront her own guarded heart. Because maybe—just maybe—there’s a love story waiting to be written for her, too.<br> <br> Emotional, deeply imaginative and brimming with valuable life lessons,&nbsp;<i>The Love Scribe&nbsp;</i>explores love, fate and the power of stories when we choose to believe in them.</p>";
