window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A Reese's Book Club Pick</b><b><br><br>Nina de Gramont's <i>The Christie Affair</i> is a stunning new novel that reimagines the unexplained eleven-day disappearance of Agatha Christie that captivated the world.<br><br>Every story has its secrets.<br>Every mystery has its motives.</b><br><br><i>“A long time ago, in another country, I nearly killed a woman. It’s a particular feeling, the urge to murder. It takes over your body so completely, it’s like a divine force, grabbing hold of your will, your limbs, your psyche. There’s a joy to it. In retrospect, it’s frightening, but I daresay in the moment it feels sweet. The way justice feels sweet.”</i><br><br>The greatest mystery wasn’t Agatha Christie’s disappearance in those eleven infamous days, it’s what she discovered.<br><br>London, 1925: In a world of townhomes and tennis matches, socialites and shooting parties, Miss Nan O’Dea became Archie Christie’s mistress, luring him away from his devoted and well-known wife, Agatha Christie.<br><br>The question is, why? Why destroy another woman’s marriage, why hatch a plot years in the making, and why murder? How was Nan O’Dea so intricately tied to those eleven mysterious days that Agatha Christie went missing?<br><br>A beguiling novel of star-crossed lovers, heartbreak, revenge, and murder—and a brilliant re-imagination of one of the most talked-about unsolved mysteries of the twentieth century<br><br><b>A Macmillan Audio production from St. Martin's Press</b></p>";
