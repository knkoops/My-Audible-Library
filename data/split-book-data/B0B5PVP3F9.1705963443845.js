window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From the </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> bestselling author of </b><b><i>The Diamond Eye</i></b><b> comes a riveting short story about an impossible connection across two centuries that could make the difference between peace or war.</b></p> <p>Yorkshire, 1943. Lily Baines, a bright young debutante increasingly ground down by an endless war, has traded in her white gloves for a set of headphones. It’s her job to intercept enemy naval communications and send them to Bletchley Park for decryption.</p> <p>One night, she picks up a transmission that isn’t code at all—it’s a cry for help.</p> <p>An American ship is taking heavy fire in the North Atlantic—but no one else has reported an attack, and the information relayed by the young US officer, Matt Jackson, seems all wrong. The contact that Lily has made on the other end of the radio channel says it’s…2023.</p> <p>Across an eighty-year gap, Lily and Matt must find a way to help each other: Matt to convince her that the war she’s fighting can still be won, and Lily to help him stave off the war to come. As their connection grows stronger, they both know there’s no telling when time will run out on their inexplicable link.</p>";
