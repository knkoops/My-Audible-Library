window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Reese’s Book Club Pick December 2023 <br> <br> A summer in Greece for three best friends ends in the unthinkable when only two return home. . . .</b><br> <br> Ten years ago, after a sun-soaked summer spent in Greece, best friends Bess and Joni were cleared of having any involvement in their friend Evangeline’s death. But that didn’t stop the media from ripping apart their teenage lives like vultures.<br> <br> While the girls were never convicted, Joni, ever the opportunist, capitalized on her newfound infamy to become a motivational speaker. Bess, on the other hand, resolved to make her life as small and controlled as possible so she wouldn’t risk losing everything all over again. And it almost worked. . . .<br> <br> Except now Joni needs a favor, and when she turns up at her old friend's doorstep asking for an alibi, Bess has no choice but to say yes. She still owes her. But as the two friends try desperately to shake off their past, they have to face reality.<br> <br> Can you ever be an innocent woman when everyone wants you to be guilty?</p>";
