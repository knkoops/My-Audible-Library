window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From the </b><b><i>New York Times </i></b><b>bestselling author of </b><b><i>The Chicken Sisters </i></b><b>comes a delightfully entertaining story about a ruse that goes awry and a chaotic homecoming that proves that confronting your past can sometimes set you free.</b></p> <p><i>Sometimes you have to go big to go home.</i></p> <p>Rhett Gallagher’s adventurous life is imploding. Just as she turns the big 4-0, her long-term relationship collapses and her gran’s death draws her back to the family farm. The only silver lining is that Rhett’s inspirational book, <i>The Modern Pioneer Girl’s Guide to Life—</i>written under a pseudonym<i>—</i>has become a wild success, so much so that when her big publicity moment comes, self-doubting Rhett panics and persuades her best friend, Jasmine, to step into the limelight in her stead.</p> <p>But their prank turns into something more when the controlling mother Rhett hasn’t seen in two decades announces her intent to sell the farm Rhett loves and expected to make her own. To save her inheritance—and her identity—Rhett must concoct a scheme that will protect her home and finally prove to her mother, and to herself, that she can stand on her own two feet.</p>";
