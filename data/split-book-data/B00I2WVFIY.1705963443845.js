window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>After war veteran Kennedy O’Brien returned home from Afghanistan and caught her husband in bed with the nanny, she lost her faith in all things male. So she started Fool Me Once Investigations to stick it to the man — because there’s no better bounty hunter than a woman scorned.</p> <p>Her latest job is a wild dog-chase to slap cuffs on a bail jumper turned Chihuahua thief, but thanks to her meddling family, Kennedy will have to put up with a partner. And it’s about the last man she’d ever pick: Her cheating ex-husband’s best friend, Griffin Crawford. As gorgeous as he is unwelcome, Griffin is a pesky (if scorching hot) reminder that Kennedy will need help to catch her man — and to open up her heart again.</p>";
