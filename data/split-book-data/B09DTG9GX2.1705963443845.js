window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>#1 </b><b><i>New York Times </i></b><b>Bestseller and winner of the Carnegie Medal!<br> <br> A gut-wrenching, startling historical thriller about communist Romania and the citizen spy network that devastated a nation, from the #1 </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> bestselling, award-winning author of </b><b><i>Salt to the Sea</i></b><b> and </b><b><i>Between Shades of Gray</i></b><b>.</b><br> <br> Romania, 1989. Communist regimes are crumbling across Europe. Seventeen-year-old Cristian Florescu dreams of becoming a writer, but Romanians aren’t free to dream; they are bound by rules and force.<br> <br> Amidst the tyrannical dictatorship of Nicolae Ceaușescu in a country governed by isolation and fear, Cristian is blackmailed by the secret police to become an informer. He’s left with only two choices: betray everyone and everything he loves—or use his position to creatively undermine the most notoriously evil dictator in Eastern Europe.<br> <br> Cristian risks everything to unmask the truth behind the regime, give voice to fellow Romanians, and expose to the world what is happening in his country. He eagerly joins the revolution to fight for change when the time arrives. But what is the cost of freedom?<br> <br> Master storyteller Ruta Sepetys is back with a historical thriller that examines the little-known history of a nation defined by silence, pain, and the unwavering conviction of the human spirit.<br> <br> <b>Praise for </b><b><i>I Must Betray You</i></b><b>:</b><br> <br> “As educational as it is thrilling...[T]he power of <i>I Must Betray You</i> [is] it doesn’t just describe the destabilizing effects of being spied on; it will make you experience them too.” <b>–</b><b><i>New York Times Book Review</i></b><br> <br> “A historical heart-pounder…Ms. Sepetys, across her body of work, has become a tribune of the unsung historical moment and a humane voice of moral clarity.”<b> –</b><b><i>The Wall Street Journal</i></b><i> </i><b><i> </i></b><br> <br> * \"Sepetys brilliantly blends a staggering amount of research with heart, craft, and insight in a way very few writers can.
