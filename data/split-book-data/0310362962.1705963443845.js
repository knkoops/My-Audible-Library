Daily habits are powerful ways to shape the heart - but do you find yourself giving in to screen time just to get through the day? You want to parent with purpose - but do you know how to start?</p> <p>Award-winning author and father of four Justin Whitmel Earley understands the tension between how you long to parent and what your daily life actually looks like. In <i>Habits of the Household, </i>Earley gives you the tools you need to create structure - from mealtimes to bedtimes - that free you to parent toddlers, kids, and teens with purpose. Learn how to:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>Develop a bedtime liturgy to settle your little ones and ground them in God's love.</li> <li>Discover a new framework for discipline as discipleship.</li> <li>Acquire simple practices for more regular and meaningful family mealtimes.</li> <li>Open your eyes to the spirituality of parenting, seeing small moments as big opportunities for spiritual formation.</li> <li>Develop a custom age chart for your family to more intentionally plan your shared years under the same roof.</li> </ul> <p>Each chapter in <i>Habits of the Household </i>ends with practical patterns, prayers, or liturgies that your family can put into practice right away. As you create liberating rhythms around your everyday routines, you will find your family has a greater sense of peace and purpose as your home becomes a place where, above all, you learn how to love.</p> <p>Figures and chapter outlines are available in the audiobook companion PDF download.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
